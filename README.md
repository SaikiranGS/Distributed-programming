# Distributed Programming using Message Passing Interface (MPI)

The purpose of this project is to calculate the term frequency(TF), inverse document frequency(IDF), Term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) scores of documents in a dataset in a distributed programming using MPI. For this project implementation, I have used news_20_group dataset.
